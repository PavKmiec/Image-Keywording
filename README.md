# IPTC-Keywording
IPTC Image Keywording script

Python script for adding keywords to image meta-data.
This script uses Clarifai API to generate keywords based on their pre-trained image recognition models.

The overall goal of this script (and maybe an app in the future) is to help automate image workflow preparation
(keyword/tag generation) for stock photography libraries such as Alamy which require tags/keywords that describe images.
